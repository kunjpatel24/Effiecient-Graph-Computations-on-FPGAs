1) ModelSim-Intel FPGA Edition: This is necessary for compiling and simulating the code on the Intel Stratix 10 MX device. If not already installed, download and install it from [the official Intel website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software-kit/750666/modelsim-intel-fpgas-standard-edition-software-version-20-1-1.html).

2) Intel Quartus Software: This is used for programming the FPGA. If not already installed, download and install it from [the official Intel website.](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/fpga/development-tools/quartus-prime/resource.html)

Step 1: Setting up your Python environment

Installing Python Libraries: Open the Command Prompt and use the following commands to install the required Python libraries:

pip install numpy
pip install networkx
pip install fpyga
Step 2: Setting up Intel Stratix 10 MX

Step 3: Downloading the code

Clone the Repository: Use Git to clone the code repository from GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git clone <github-repository-url>
Step 4: Running the code

Load the Code in ModelSim: Open ModelSim-Intel FPGA Edition and load your Python code.

Step 5: Importing the dataset files
